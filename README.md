# Coding-Yabe-Sei
#### A multi-purpose discord bot that has, moderation, fun, games, and learning commands!

## [Invite](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=506254054339379220&scope=bot&permissions=8)
Here's the [Link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=506254054339379220&scope=bot&permissions=8) to invite yabe to your server, she currently requires permissions that aren't really used, but we plan on making use of such perms.

## Features
#### Moderation
The Usual
- Kick (requires for the user doing the kicking to have `Kick Members` permission, `yabe kick <@user> <reason for kick> (optional)`)
- Ban (requires for the user doing the banning to have `Ban Members` permission, `yabe ban <@user> <reason for ban> (optional)`)
- Remove (requires for the user deleting the messages to have `Manage Messages` permission, `yabe rem <number of message to delete>`)

#### Fun
- Meme (random meme from the internet, `yabe meme`)
- Slap (slaps the user you mention, `yabe slap <@user to slap>`)
- Smug (posts a random smug anime girl, `yabe smug`)
and many more

#### Games
- 8ball (ask yabe a question and she'll give you your desired answer, `yabe 8ball <question>`)
- Roll (rolls )
- Flip
We know it's not a lot but we'll try to add better games as soon as we get better hosting.

## Honorable mentions
##### - Translate:
Yabe can translate any piece of text you provide from almost all languages you can think of, just do `yabe translate list` for a list of supported languages and their respective ISO-639-1 codes, and `yabe help translate` on how to use the command.
##### - Learn:
Yabe has a learn command for learning concepts in various programming languages.
This command is still a work-in-progress so it's doesn't work yet.
